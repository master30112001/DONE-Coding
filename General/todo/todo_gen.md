**MISC 1**
Key Differences Between Character Array and String
A character array is a collection of variables which are of character datatype. String is a class that is instantiated to declare strings.
Using index value you can access a character from a character array. On the other hand, if you want to access a particular character in a string, you can access it by function stringâ€™s_name.charAt(index).
As an array is not a datatype similarly a character also is not a datatype. On the other hand, String being a class act as a reference type hence, it can be said String is a data type.
You can not apply any operator on a character array whereas, you can apply operators on String.
Being an array character array has a fixed length and its boundaries can be easily overrun. Where String does not have any boundaries.
Array elements are stored in a contiguous memory location hence that can be accessed faster than string variable.
