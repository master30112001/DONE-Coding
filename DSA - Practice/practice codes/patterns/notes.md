## POINT 1

One thing to understand is how many times your loop will run

@ @ @

@ @
@ @
@ @

The above two are different questions
their while loops will run for different number of times

## POINT 2

In pattern questions, generally you can check how the column varies according to the row
For example, to display
1 1 1
2 2 2
3 3 3

Here, in every column, the value is `row+1`
CHECK relationship between `row` & `col`
