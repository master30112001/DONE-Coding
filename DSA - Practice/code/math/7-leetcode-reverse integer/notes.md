**7. Reverse Integer**

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Example 1:
Input: x = 123
Output: 321

Example 2:
Input: x = -123
Output: -321

Example 3:
Input: x = 120
Output: 21

Remainder of a negative number is NEGATIVE only.

eg.
-123%10

is -3

and NOT 3
